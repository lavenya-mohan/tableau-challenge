Citi Bike is a popular bike-sharing program launched in New York City in 2013, offering an eco-friendly transportation option for short trips. It allows users to rent bikes from one station and return them to another across the city, with stations located throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and parts of the Bronx. Users can opt for annual memberships, which offer unlimited 30-minute rides, or purchase single rides or day passes for casual usage. The system includes both classic bikes and electric bikes, catering to different preferences and needs. Citi Bike has become one of the largest bike-sharing programs in the United States, contributing to sustainable transportation in the city.

## Benefits

The program provides multiple benefits, including reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and promoting healthy exercise for users. It offers a convenient and affordable alternative to traditional forms of transport, especially for short-distance travel.

## Challenges

However, challenges like bike availability, infrastructure issues, and pricing for longer rides remain. Despite these, Citi Bike has gained popularity among both locals and tourists, who appreciate the flexibility and convenience it offers for exploring New York City.

## Data Usage

Data collected from the system is used to optimize station placement, monitor usage trends, and inform urban planning decisions aimed at creating more sustainable, bike-friendly environments.
